A high-performance ray tracing engine written in C, capable of rendering photorealistic 3D scenes with advanced lighting, materials, and geometric shapes. This project implements a complete ray tracer from scratch using mathematical algorithms for realistic light simulation.

## üéØ Project Overview

miniRT is a ray tracing renderer that simulates the physical behavior of light to create realistic images. The engine traces rays from the camera through each pixel of the screen, calculating how light interacts with objects in the 3D scene to produce the final image.

### How Ray Tracing Works

1. **Ray Generation**: For each pixel on the screen, a ray is cast from the camera through that pixel into the 3D scene
2. **Intersection Testing**: The ray is tested against all objects in the scene to find the closest intersection point
3. **Lighting Calculation**: At the intersection point, lighting is calculated based on:
   - Direct illumination from light sources
   - Material properties (color, reflectivity, transparency)
   - Surface normals and viewing angles
4. **Recursive Reflection/Refraction**: Additional rays are cast for reflective and refractive materials
5. **Color Accumulation**: All lighting contributions are combined to determine the final pixel color
